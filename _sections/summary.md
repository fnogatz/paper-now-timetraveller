In this project we created an interactive visualisation of spatio-temporal trace data as they are specified in the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format or created by tools like [Veins](http://veins.car2x.org/). It allows the interactive exploration of the given data by scrolling through the time and setting the animation speed. The [timetraveller](#source-code-timetraveller) server stays performant even with large datasets and at a high animation speed.
