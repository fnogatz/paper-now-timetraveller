With the growth of GPS-aided smartphones, data series based on location and time has become relevant to a large number of people, tracking their positions while walking or searching for nearby taxis. Suchlike so called spatio-temporal data of objects with changing positions over time is a challenge for both databases and visualisation tools: Because of a continuous data stream the amount of information increases very fast.

In this project we created various tools to parse, transform and display spatio-temporal datasets. The result, called *Timetraveller*, can be used to interactively explore data from different sources. As a reference, a CSV import for VANET simulation traces by [Veins](http://veins.car2x.org/) has been implemented as well as a parser for transit data specified in the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format.
