In times of big data, the usage especially of spatio-temporal data has increased drastically: People are sharing their location by using Foursquare and trace their walking routes with the hel of smartphones. Besides that we constantly consume spatio-temporal data, for example by checking the train's current position. The use cases are very diverse and by now part of everyday life.

On the other hand, the amount of this spatio-temporal data is very big: Due to the continuous data stream the trace of the Foursquare user, runner or train will contain in general more points than that are necessary to get a sufficent visualisation.

The aim of this project was to create an interactive visualisation to explore spatio-temporal data of different data sources. The client-server-architecture should ensure, that the visualisation stays still performant for a large number of traces without omitting too much information on each. 

The project has been implemented as part of the Masters programme in Computer Science at the [University of Ulm](http://uni-ulm.de). It has been supervised by [Benjamin Erb](http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/vs/persons/benjamin-erb/) and [Rens van der Heijden](http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/vs/persons/rens-van-der-heijden.html) of the [Institute of Distributed Systems](http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/vs.html).

### Requirements

As stated before, the interactive explorer should be implemented as a web-based service. It was required to support the visualisation of different data sources, especially:

* tracelogs generated by network simulation tools like [Veins](http://veins.car2x.org/),
* public transit data specified in the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format.

Besides that, the user should be able to manipulate the data explorer in a way, that the map section, time, and speed of the visualization can be adjusted. The data storage of the spatio-temporal trace data should be searchable, not necessarily by use of the graphical interface. It should be possible to add realtime data as source in the future.
